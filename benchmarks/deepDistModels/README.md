# Deep Distributional Models

To reproduce the results,

* use the Jupyter Notebook to create the data
* run the R markdown file to 
    + run SDDL for 20 times
    + run Deep Joint Mean and Quantile Regression by Rodrigues and Pereira (2018)
    + produce Figure 3 (subject to smaller changes due to network initialization).
