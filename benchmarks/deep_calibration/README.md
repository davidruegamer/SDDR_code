# Deep Calibrated Regression

To reproduce the results of the benchmark section

* clone the DistCal repository of the method *Distribution Calibration for Regression* by Song et al. (2019) from [their repository](https://github.com/Srceh/DistCal)
* run the Python files corresponding to the names of the data sets to reproduce results for GPR, IR and GPB reported in our paper.
* run the R files corresponding to the names of the data sets to reproduce results for SDDR and each of the benchmark data sets.
